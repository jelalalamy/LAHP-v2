# LAHP v2
LAHP (La HomePage) is a project I began for fun in Fall 2021 when I began learning web dev. It is heavily inspired by [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) which is another fantastic (and free) extension. If you're curious about LAHP v1, you can find it here: [LAHP v1](https://github.com/jelalalamy/LAHP).

Features include:

- Hourly weather updates based on your location
- Daily inspirational quote
- View your todo list
- Open your calendar
- Set a reminder
- Start a timer
